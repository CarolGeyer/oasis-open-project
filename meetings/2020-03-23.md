**Date:** 23 March 2020

**Present:** Tas Dienes (EF), Virgil Griffith (EF Emeritus), John Wolpert (Baseline TSC Chair), Dan Burnett (ConsenSys), Jory Burson (OASIS)

1. **Quick Status Update**
    * Baseline Updates
        * First TSC Meeting & SSC Meetings happened this morning
            * Recruiting Maintainers 
            * Want to send a note to the community - call for maintainers
                * Anybody can be one, this is about level setting - every maintainer should be part of an onboarding session
                * Will want some content for that
        * Milestone: Passed Besu in number of stars on GitHub - measure of the power of the message - excites a lot of people
2. **Other Administration**
    * More updates needed to README 
    * Renewal emails going out this week - our project ‘renews’ in May 
3. **JSON RPC & Other Projects**
    * Documenting the EVM
        * Chaals has some action items here
    * OVM - optimism.io (plasma replacement) - off chain evm
        * AI: Tas will contact the group
    * Eth 2 standards - may be premature to work on these
    * JSON RPC spec seems “settled” - do we need a project here? 

4. **Community Engagement**
    * Website is not likely to be a good motivator - use the github org as that space for now
    * Write post for Eth Magicians Board
        * Also post about the EVM 
        * Maybe work with Hudson
        * What's the messaging we want to convey
            * Baseline & growth
            * Talk about the broader framework of the program
            * What else - other projects we’re tracking: evm, tokenscript 
                * Quote about interest in the other projects - Nick? ETClabs (talk to John)
    * New / addl tools recommended
    * Use of the email list
