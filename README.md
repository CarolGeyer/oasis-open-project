# Ethereum OASIS Open Project
Everything related to the Ethereum open source and open standards developing under OASIS.

The Ethereum OASIS Open Project is an [OASIS Open Project](http://oasis-open-projects.org/) that exists to provide a neutral forum for diverse stakeholders to create high-quality specifications that facilitate Ethereumâ€™s longevity, interoperability, and ease of integration. The Ethereum OASIS Project intends to develop clear, open standards, high-quality documentation, and shared test suites that facilitate new features and enhancements to the Ethereum protocol.

For more information on the goals of this effort, see the [project charter](./PROJECT_CHARTER.md). 

## List of projects & TSCs
